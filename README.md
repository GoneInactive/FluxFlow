# FluxFlow

FluxFlow is a dynamic task orchestrator designed to help you manage your tasks efficiently. It allows you to organize tasks by status and project categories, set priorities, and keep track of your progress. All your data is saved locally in your browser, so you can close and reopen the application without losing your progress.

## Features

*   **Task Management**: Add, edit, and delete tasks with titles, descriptions, status, project, and priority.
*   **Customizable Categories**: Create and manage your own status and project categories with custom names and colors.
*   **Task Filtering**: Filter tasks by status, project, and priority to easily find what you're looking for.
*   **Local Data Persistence**: All your tasks and category configurations are saved automatically in your browser's local storage.
*   **Intuitive UI**: A clean and responsive user interface for a smooth task management experience.
